# Implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT 

> Overview
>In this lab, you implement Private Google Access and Cloud NAT for a VM instance that doesn't have an external IP address. Then, you verify access to public IP addresses of Google APIs and services and other connections to the internet.

>VM instances without external IP addresses are isolated from external networks. Using Cloud NAT, these instances can access the internet for updates and patches, and in some cases, for bootstrapping. As a managed service, Cloud NAT provides high availability without user management and intervention.

# Objectives
> In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

-Configure a VM instance that doesn't have an external IP address

-Connect to a VM instance using an Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) tunnel

-Enable Private Google Access on a subnet

-Configure a Cloud NAT gateway

-Verify access to public IP addresses of Google APIs and services and other connections to the internet

# Task 1. Create the VM instance

# Task 2. Enable Private Google Access

# Task 3. Configure a Cloud NAT gateway

# Task 4. Configure and view logs with Cloud NAT Logging
